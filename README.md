 ## PROJECT IDEA 1 : 
 
  #### TITLE : DETECTION AND RECOGNITION OF TRAFFIC SIGN USING OCR AND COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES.
  
  #### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
  ###### To Detect the Road Traffic Sign using Real time OCR and Text Detection with TensorFlow, OpenCV and Tesseract.
  
  #### ABSTRACT
  ###### We will take the Traffic sign image dataset and some Traffic video Sample files as a train and test Data for Input (fig 1). The detection of an object at a distant road sign was low, recognition may get affected due to the changes in contrast at night and bad weather. So, we use the deep learning techniques and Real time OCR and Text Detection with TensorFlow, OpenCV technique to find the text on the traffic sign board and displays the text. The Proposed System should detect and correctly classify the traffic Sign

  #### Persona(s)
  ###### Algorithm, we will be using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithm and deep learning techniques to Detect the Traffic Signs which include then text detection on sign boards.For the detection and recognition of traffic signals the proposed algorithm primarily focus on cutting-edge technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text Detection with TensorFlow, OpenCV and Tesseract. the basic work of this technique is that which is based on a quicker region-based convolutional neural network as it is possible to automatically extract the best features of a target image for object detection using deep learning. Here we are coming up with a wide range of sample images and video files of different weather condition images as input and detection will be done using code and will try to develop an Android app. The results will be achieved with minimum preprocessing and contour detection followed by text recognition using OCR technique with TensorFlow and open cv. and also detecting other symbolic signs.

 ## PROJECT IDEA 2 : 
 
  #### TITLE : SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR PRODUCT RATING
  
  #### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
  ###### This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system for product rating. It is an e-commerce web application. The main goal of this sentiment analysis system is to understand the hidden sentiments of customers in feedback and comments and analyze their product rating patterns.
  
  #### ABSTRACT
  ###### When registered customers use this app to view products, product features, and comment on different products, the sentiment analysis system will analyze the comments of various users and ranks products accordingly. The system leverages a database of sentiment-based keywords (including positivity or negativity weight).
  ###### So, when a user comments on a particular product, the sentiment analysis system analyzes the keywords in the comment to find the match with the keywords stored in the database. After analyzing the matches against the positive and negative keywords and sentiments, the system ranks a product as good, bad, and very bad. Thus, users can use this application to find out reviews on a product.

## PROJECT IDEA 3 : 
   
  #### TITLE : DATA LEAK DETECTION
 
  #### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
  ###### In the course of doing buisiness , sometimes sensitive data must be given to third parties. some of the data is leaked and found in an  unauthorized   place . The distributor cannot blame the agent without any evidence . This project identifies the agent who leaked the data with enough evidence . The objective of this project is to improve the probability of identifying leakages using Data Allocation Strategies across the agents and also to identify the guilty party who leaked the data by injecting "realistic but fake" data records.
 
  #### ABSTRACT 
  ###### A data distributor has given sensitive data to a set of supposedly trusted agents . Sometimes data is leaked and found in unauthorized place e.g. on the web or in somebodys laptop . Data leakage happens every day when confidential buisiness information are leaked out. When these are leaked out it leaves the company unprotected and goes outside the jurisdiction of the corporation.
 
  #### Persona(s)
  ###### Data leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation. Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage.
