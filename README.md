## PROJECT IDEA 1 : 
   
  #### TITLE : DATA LEAK DETECTION
 
  #### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
              In the course of doing buisiness , sometimes sensitive data must be given to third parties. some of the data is leaked and found in an  unauthorized   place . The distributor cannot blame the agent without any evidence . This project identifies the agent who leaked the data with enough evidence . The objective of this project is to improve the probability of identifying leakages using Data Allocation Strategies across the agents and also to identify the guilty party who leaked the data by injecting "realistic but fake" data records.
 
  #### ABSTRACT 
              A data distributor has given sensitive data to a set of supposedly trusted agents . Sometimes data is leaked and found in unauthorized place e.g. on the web or in somebodys laptop . Data leakage happens every day when confidential buisiness information are leaked out. When these are leaked out it leaves the company unprotected and goes outside the jurisdiction of the corporation.
